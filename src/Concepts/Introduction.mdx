# Hydrogen UI React

<Subtitle>v1.0.4</Subtitle>

Welcome to Hydrogen UI, a design system crafted to extend the capabilities of Microsoft's Fluent UI. Hydrogen UI enhances the Fluent UI framework by introducing additional components, styles, and utilities that are not natively available in Fluent UI. This design system aims to provide developers and designers with a more robust and flexible toolkit, enabling the creation of cohesive, user-friendly interfaces that adhere to the principles of modern design.

## Why Hydrogen UI?

While Fluent UI is a powerful and widely adopted design system, many projects require more specialized components and features that are not included in the standard Fluent UI package, such as components usefull for generic websites or full scale dashboards. Hydrogen UI fills this gap by offering a curated collection of extra components designed to seamlessly integrate with Fluent UI, ensuring a consistent look and feel across your applications.

### Key Features:

- **Expanded Component Library**: Hydrogen UI includes a wide range of additional components that complement Fluent UI, such as versatile navigation elements.
- **Seamless Integration**: Built to work hand-in-hand with Fluent UI, Hydrogen UI maintains the same design language and conventions, making it easy to adopt and integrate into existing projects.
- **Customizability**: While adhering to Fluent UI's design principles, Hydrogen UI offers increased flexibility, allowing you to tailor components to your specific needs without compromising on design consistency.

### Who Should Use Hydrogen UI?

Hydrogen UI is ideal for teams and individuals who are already using Fluent UI but require more advanced or specialized components for their projects. Whether you are building enterprise-grade applications, dashboards, or interactive interfaces, Hydrogen UI provides the tools needed to deliver a polished and professional user experience.
